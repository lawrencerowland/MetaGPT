## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry point of the application. Initializes the Flask application and the database."),
    ("models.py", "Defines the User, Contractor, and Review classes. Handles database operations."),
    ("forms.py", "Defines the forms for user input. Handles form validation."),
    ("views.py", "Defines the routes and views for the Flask application."),
    ("recommender.py", "Implements the recommendation algorithm. Depends on models.py for accessing User and Contractor data."),
    ("tests.py", "Contains unit tests for the application. Depends on all other files.")
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "models.py",
    "forms.py",
    "recommender.py",
    "views.py",
    "main.py",
    "tests.py"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
'models.py' contains the User, Contractor, and Review classes. These classes are used throughout the application to handle data.
'forms.py' contains the forms for user input. These forms are used in 'views.py' to handle user input.
'recommender.py' contains the recommendation algorithm. This algorithm is used in 'views.py' to provide recommendations to the user.
'main.py' is the main entry point of the application. It initializes the Flask application and the database.
'tests.py' contains unit tests for the application. It depends on all other files.
"""
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear. The main entry point of the application is 'main.py'. The Flask application and the database are initialized in 'main.py'. The recommendation algorithm is implemented in 'recommender.py' and depends on 'models.py' for accessing User and Contractor data.
