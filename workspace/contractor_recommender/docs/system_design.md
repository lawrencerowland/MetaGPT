## Implementation approach
The system will be implemented using Python, with the Flask framework for the web interface. The recommendation algorithm will be based on collaborative filtering, using the Surprise library. The database will be handled using SQLAlchemy ORM for easier database operations. The feedback mechanism will be implemented using Flask-WTF for form handling. For testing, we will use the pytest framework.

## Data structures and interface definitions
```mermaid

    class User{
        +int id
        +str username
        +str email
        +str password_hash
        +list saved_contractors
        +__init__(username: str, email: str, password: str)
        +check_password(password: str): bool
    }
    class Contractor{
        +int id
        +str name
        +str specialty
        +float rating
        +str description
        +__init__(name: str, specialty: str, rating: float, description: str)
    }
    class Review{
        +int id
        +str content
        +float rating
        +User user
        +Contractor contractor
        +__init__(content: str, rating: float, user: User, contractor: Contractor)
    }
    User "1" -- "*" Contractor: saves
    User "1" -- "*" Review: writes
    Contractor "1" -- "*" Review: has
```

## Program call flow
```mermaid

    participant M as Main
    participant U as User
    participant C as Contractor
    participant R as Review
    M->>U: create user
    U->>M: return user
    M->>C: create contractor
    C->>M: return contractor
    M->>R: create review
    R->>M: return review
    M->>U: save contractor
    U->>M: return updated user
    M->>U: get saved contractors
    U->>M: return saved contractors
    M->>U: delete saved contractor
    U->>M: return updated user
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear to me.
